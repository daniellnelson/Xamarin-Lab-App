This is a cross platform Xamarin Application for me to test out mobile app development ideas.

So far it has the ability to create a list of things and a in progress search function. 

The user can search for a game, and with use of the IGDB API, a record of at most 10 games with similar characters are returned in json format. 

Currently finishing up the ability to select a record and store it as a new item instance.
